Kiss singer Gene Simmons has admitted the band struggle to contain fans buying overinflated prices for their gigs on the secondary ticketing market.

He said: "I don't like it but capitalism is capitalism, if you buy a piece of furniture you're allowed if you sell it for a profit. But we do try to limit that sort of shenanigans."

The band currently offer tour tickets on their own website.

"You try to do the best you can but it is a free market system," he added. 

"The nature of money is that people tend to abuse it and when there the chance to make hideous sums on somebody who really want something, people will take advantage of people."

His comments seem to signal a changing attitude in the singer, having previously been quoted as being broadly supportive of secondary ticketing, 
telling website Ticketnews in 2008:


"There is no secondary [ticket] market; there's only the market. That's the reality, and everything else is political jumbling. 

"If somebody wants a ticket, they'll buy it or they won't."

Senior figures in the music industry have criticised the secondary ticketing market,  with concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith calling secondary ticketing websites 
"a national disgrace"
.

Simmons is busy promoting a live film from the Kiss residency at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel 
which is due to hit selected cinemas
 across the world on 25 May.

It's the first time the band, whose self-titled debut album was released more than 40 years ago, recorded a live concert. 

"We like to do things big, we've never done anything small since the first time we blew up a stage," said Simmons.

"What we do is, we shake the heavens."
