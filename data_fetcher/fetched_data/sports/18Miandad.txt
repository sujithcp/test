 Former captain Javed Miandad has slammed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for turning a blind eye to indiscipline by senior players.

Miandad lashed out at PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and other top officials of the board for being spineless in dealing with indisciplined players.

“Pakistan cricket will have to bear the consequences of weak governance from the board officials in the future. In the past also the authorities turned a blind eye to acts of indiscipline and it was Pakistan cricket that suffered,” he said in an interview.

Miandad was shocked that the board had ignored senior batsman Younis Khan’s show of dissent during the Pakistan Cup one-day tournament in Faisalabad.

 The PCB decided against any disciplinary action against Younis after he apologised for quitting the Pakistan Cup national one-day competition after a dispute with match officials.

 In a press release the PCB said on Monday that Younis had contacted Shaharyar Khan and apologised for his misconduct during the ongoing Pakistan Cup in Faisalabad.

 Younis, who is also one of PCB’s advisors on cricketing affairs, expressed willingness to participate in the remainder of the tournament.

 Miandad said no matter how big a player is indiscipline could not be tolerated at any cost as it left a bad precedent for the other players.

 He noted this was not the first time that Mr. Shaharyar had ignored acts of indiscipline.

 He said that to make matters worse five other Pakistan players were reported to have got into a brawl at a theatre in Faisalabad where they went to watch a dance drama.

 “What examples are we setting for our younger generation of players.” 

 PCB spokesman Amjad Bhatti said that the board was looking into the said incident and would not comment before finding out the facts.
