Rising Pune Supergiants’ Ashok Dinda expressed relief after the team’s win against Sunrisers Hyderabad. 


“It’s very nice to win the match. It was important. We played well, batting and bowling and fielding also,” he said at the post-match press conference last night after RPS won by 34 runs in the rain-hit match.



Electing to bowl after winning the toss, RPS restricted Sunrisers to 118 for the loss of eight wickets. In response, Pune made 94 for three in 11 over before rain interrupted the match.



Replying to a query, Dinda said the rain did not help the team in any way. “No, sometimes it’s disturbing. Because, we are going and coming back again. For batsmen, it is very tough.”



Dinda was happy to have got the crucial wicket of SRH captain and batting mainstay David Warner.



“A plan was there for Warner... just hit the perfect area and bowl incoming deliveries to David Warner. For me, it was out swing, for him it was in swing. That was the plan, just wicket to wicket bowling,” he said.
