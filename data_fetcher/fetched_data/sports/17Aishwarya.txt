Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan on Monday came out in support of Bollywood star Salman Khan’s appointment as goodwill ambassador of India’s contingent for the upcoming Rio Olympics.

Salman’s selection had stirred up a controversy as many feel that it should have gone to a sports icon even as some sports personalities, actors and politicians support Indian Olympics Association’s decision to appoint the popular movie star.

When asked about her views on the controversy, Aishwarya said, “I have to say that anyone, who is doing good to represent the country or working or speaking or standing for the betterment of art, music or sports, is wonderful and the person needs to be recognised.”
