Vijender Singh has accepted British pro Amir Khan's challenge to fight in India, saying it will prove to be a big boost to the sport in the country.



Commenting on Amir’s challenge, Vijender said: “I accept the challenge of Amir Khan and I am sure this fight will be a big boost to boxing in our country.



“As we both fight in different weight categories so will have to see whether Amir (middleweight) gains or I (super middleweight) have to lose weight. I have started my professional boxing career last year only and have made only 4 appearances in the pro ring.



“It might take me just one more year when I will be ready to fight against Amir Khan. I am sure this fight will attract international limelight and attention. Currently I am focusing on my next fight scheduled for April 30 against Matiouze Royer at Copper Box Arena,” he added.
