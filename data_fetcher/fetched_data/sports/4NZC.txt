New Zealand Cricket has opened up to the possibility of playing a day-night Test match with the pink ball during the tour of India later this year.



The BCCI last week said it is all set to host its first-ever day-night cricket Test against New Zealand in October.



NZC chief executive David White had talks with the Indian officials during the International Cricket Council meeting in Dubai late last week.



“We’ve said we are receptive to the idea,” 
New Zealand Herald 
quoted White as saying. “We will work closely with the players, but in saying that, if the trials look good and they (India) are comfortable with (the trials) it’s very positive from our point of view. We believe day-night Test cricket has a big future.” 


Mumbai could emerge as the most likely venue to host the game should the two boards go ahead with the plan. 



Pink balls for Duleep




India will try out playing with pink balls in domestic matches before New Zealand’s arrival.



BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur had said: “We have decided that we will play one day-night Test match with pink ball against New Zealand later this year. 


“Before that Duleep Trophy will act as a dress rehearsal for the day-night Test.”



Thakur said that the main objective of the Duleep Trophy will be to check how the pink Kookaburra behaves under lights in sub-continental conditions.



White said there was a solid consensus around the ICC table in Dubai about the importance of day-night cricket in the future Test landscape.



“The sentiment was very positive. Everyone realises it’s going to be important for the future of the Test format to make it accessible to the fans.” 


New Zealand played Australia in the world’s first day-night Test in Adelaide last year.
