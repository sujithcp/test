The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the 
Maharshtra Cricket Associationâ€™s appeal
 against the 
Bombay High Court order
 to shift IPL matches out of the State post April 30. 


The cricket association, in its plea, had said that it will not be using potable water for the cricket pitches but use treated sewage water instead.
