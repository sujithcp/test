 With the domestic league title sewn up, a confident Bengaluru FC (BFC) side has set its sights on the international stage. 

BFC — crowned the I-League champion a few days ago — faces Lao Toyota FC in a crucial AFC Cup tie here on Wednesday. Three points will all but guarantee the home team a spot in the knockout rounds, while Lao Toyota needs to put on a good show to stay afloat.

Facing BFC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium poses a stiff challenge, but Lao Toyota can take heart from a 2-1 victory notched up in its opening Group ‘H’ game, held at Vientiane (Laos) two months ago.

Ashley Westwood, BFC coach, stated that he will field his best players on Wednesday. 

“I had rested many of our top guys against Mohun Bagan on Saturday, because we had already won the I-League Trophy by that stage. However, this is a different situation, so I’ll pick the best team,” Westwood said here on Tuesday.

The Englishman added that it was vital for his men to record a win against the Laos unit, as it would be tough to expect a positive result for BFC in its final group stage match — against Malaysian powerhouse and defending champion, Johor Darul Ta’zim (at Johor next month).

Lao Toyota — currently the Lao Premier League table-topper, with four victories in as many outings — will rely on prolific Japanese striker Kazuo Homma to do the job up front. 

“This is the most important match of the tournament for us,” visiting coach, Valakone Phomphakdy, said.
